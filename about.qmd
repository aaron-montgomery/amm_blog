Hi! I’m Aaron Montgomery, an Associate Professor at 
[Baldwin Wallace University](https://www.bw.edu/). I received a PhD in 
Mathematics (specializing in Probability Theory) in 2013 at the University of 
Oregon under the direction of [David Levin](https://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~dlevin/).
Since then, I have been a member of the BW Mathematics and Statistics faculty, 
and more recently I have become the coordinator of the new 
[Data Science](https://www.bw.edu/academics/undergraduate/data-science/) and
[Data Analytics](https://www.bw.edu/academics/undergraduate/data-analytics/)
programs.

I am always open to collaborating on interesting statistical or data-oriented 
projects! You can reach me at `amontgom` (atsymbol) `bw.edu`.
